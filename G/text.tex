\subsubsection{Partial implementation}
We have worked hard on getting the Parser implemented, as well as we would like,
though we're still far off.

In order to complete the Parser.grm, certain changes to the rest of the source
(namely Driver.sml, Type.sml and AbSyn.sml) were required, as to facilitate
the top-down approach, which is now used.


% BAAH repetition!
\paragraph{Changes to AbSyn.sml} were required in order to properly implement
the top-down parser, which we now have.
% In particular, we have changed the following:\\
%% Listing/Other means of indicating changes.

\paragraph{Changes to Type.sml} include changes that were required to resolve
various issues stemming from changes to the rest of the source.

\subsubsection{Future/Missing implementation(s) and Program pitfalls}
As we have yet to implement the type-checker of our compiler, running Paladim
with some files will result in Type errors.
