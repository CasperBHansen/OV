\begin{abstract}
This document describes the development of the Paladim programming language,
which is a pascal-like imperative language with functions and procedures, which
uses multidimensional regular arrays.

Each subtask will be addressed in its own subsection of the document.

\subsection{Planned schedule}
Having a development schedule helps us keep things organized and makes sure
that we can meet the deadlines. We provide our development schedule for our
own benefit and such that the instructor can provide feedback on possible
difficulties we may encounter, such that it can adjust it accordingly.

The development schedule is, however, subject to change. For reasons given
above, and unforeseen difficulties may or may not force us to reschedule.

\section{Progress}
This section discusses the advancements, we have made in the above tasks.

\subsection{Parser}
We have made the new parser support the entire syntax.
We have changed the syntax og LVAL and value to include int*int so they can pass down position.
We have made two seperate conditional statements if-then and if-then-else.
If-then has been given a lower precedence than if-then-else to resolve a conflict.

\subsubsection{Tests}
{\it not applicable at this time}%
\paragraph{One-shot testing}
The testing has so far only involved single-shot testing, insofar as it has
been applicable.

Generally we have tested the implementation by recompiling the source, and
testing each file, thus, letting us see 1) the compiler output for any
warnings/errors and 2) the programme output, so that we may verify that it
is correct.
